# Cell free enzymatic catalysis kinetics simulation code
Cell free enzyme catalysis kinetics for converting glucose to terpene.  

## How to use

Create envirionment by running:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

Then activate environment:

`conda activate g2t-env`

install this package in the root directory of this package:

`conda develop .`

Now you can run notebooks with `g2t-env`
